# Student resources

This document outlines free resources you can use for your software projects.

Accurate as of Feb. 1, 2021

## Version Control Systems (VCS)

Hosted VCS is essential as you will frequently receive paired assignments. Solutions listed below
are specifically tailored for students as all of them provide private repositories free of charge.

We recommend using git, but _any_ VCS is better than not using one at all.

### Cloud Repository Hosting

#### GitLab

GitLab is a complete VCS solution that offers free unlimited public and private repositories, along
with several other features such as continuous integration.

You can register for the hosted version [here](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in),
or [install it on your own server](https://about.gitlab.com/installation/).

NOTE: GitLab supports both git and hg (Mercurial).

#### GitHub

A free tier GitHub account supports free unlimited private repositories and unlimited collaborators.

If you want additional features, GitHub is also offering an education account for students or
university teaching staff. University email is required for verification, and the process could take
up to 2 weeks. (In practice, after clicking the link in the confirmation email, your account will be
automatically promoted to student account).

In addition, students will also receive a list of bundled services to use with GitHub such as free
CI times for private repositories.

NOTE: GitHub only supports git.

Apply [here](https://education.github.com/) for the student account.

#### BitBucket

Standard BitBucket account supports unlimited private repositories for teams with up to 5 users.

BitBucket also offers free academic accounts that supports team of unlimited members. University
email verification is required upon registration.

NOTE: BitBucket supports git only.

Apply by filling out the
[form](https://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license).

### Tutorials

Atlassian (makers of BitBucket, Jira, Confluence, etc) have a _wonderful_
series of tutorials on git, ranging from basic commands to advanced usage and team workflow. You can
find the whole list
[here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).

We recommend you work through the tutorials, setting up a dummy repository and trying the commands
as you read through the docs. Remember that the purpose is to _understand how git works_ and _how it
can help you_ manage your work, not just to blindly type commands.

Once you have a good foundation of using git on your own, the tutorials under the Collaborating
category, e.g. [Syncing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing)
and [Using branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches), may help you organize
your team workflow.

Note than you don't need to use BitBucket in particular for these tutorials.

## IDE

Most IDEs are open-source but a few are paid.

### JetBrains (incl. IntelliJ IDEA and related products)

JetBrain offers their entire suite of IDE and programming related products for free given that you
can prove that you are a student or teaching staff member.

Apply [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).

**IntelliJ IDEA will be the only supported IDE in the labs.**
