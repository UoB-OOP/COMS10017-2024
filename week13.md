# Task 1: Teamwork in the Cloud

The first two weeks of labs will be warm-up exercises giving you time to set up your working
methods, test and try all the basic Java concepts given in lectures and as lab tasks, and also
establish how to work in your team effectively and efficiently. The purpose of this first Task 1 is
to try out the Java toolchain, in particular use the `javac`, `java` and `git` commands to work
together in your pair programming team in the Cloud. Nothing needs to be submitted, and there are no
marks, but it is essential to do this formative exercise to get off to a good start.

## Pair Programming Team

We expect you to do all the exercises and projects for the unit in pairs. Everybody should by now be
in a team of two registered on the unit website. You should use the labs to work through the tasks
together, and support the labs with some extra work in your team outside labs if required. This is
how you will learn most throughout the unit. From week 15 onwards you should spend about 7h per week
on this unit including labs and lectures. This exercise should take you no longer than 2h.

## Code Sharing

At the end of this lab you should be able to work in your pair programming team together on a
private online repository where you can share code within your team. You are at no point allowed to
share any code you develop between teams, your project submission later in the year in particular
may be checked for plagiarism using automatic, online and manual checks. Both publishing or allowing
access to your code to someone outside your team or using code from someone else without clear
source indications may amount to plagiarism offences. In any case, all third party code must be
cited/referenced as such, with the extent and original source provided in the code base.

## Compiling and Running Java Programs

You should have completed the setup process in Task 0 before doing this. To check that you have the
javac and java commands installed properly, type:

```shell
> javac -version
> java -version
```

You should get a message mentioning the version number (should be the same for both `java`
and `javac`) in each case. Next, create a local project directory wherein you would like to develop
your first tiny project (for instance within `C:/Users/YourUserName/Projects` on Windows
or `~/Projects` on Linux/macOS). In this directory create for instance the two source files needed
for `RobotWorld`, that is `Robot.java`
and `RobotWorld.java` as discussed in the first lecture. Note that there is a convention that Java
source files start with a capital letter. On Windows (and some Macs), you need to be careful because
the filestore is (partly) case-insensitive. Now try compiling your Java program within your project
directory:

```shell
> javac RobotWorld.java
````

You will find that this has created two files called `Robot.class` and `RobotWorld.class`. The
compiler realised there was a dependency and that both Java class files are required in `RobotWorld`
and thus compiled both. Now run the program:

```shell
> java RobotWorld
C3PO says 'Hello, Java!'
```

* * *

**TODO:** Make sure you can compile and run Java programs. Create a few more project folders for the
other example programs from the lectures so far, then compile and run them. Understand what is going
on in these programs - how and why they work.

## Managing Code and using a Cloud Repository

**Important:
This guide may be easier to grasp once you have completed *Exercise 1* of the Software Tools (
COMS10012) unit, we expect everyone to be taking that unit.**

In order to work together as a team both of you need to be able to work on the same code and access
it from anywhere, your project also needs to be backed up and version control should be available.
To achieve all this, first install Git on your system (which is already installed in the lab), and
check all is setup properly asking for the Git version ready to run:

```shell
> git --version
```
Note that we advise that Windows users use [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) as this seamlessly manages your credentials. 
Linux and Mac users should refer to Github's guide: [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
Note that this distinction means that you will refer to your remote repo differently, depending on whether your are a Windows, Mac or Linux user.

Git should report back the version you have installed. Next, we need a place in the Cloud to be used
as a repository. Only one repository is needed for your entire team, that is why only one of you
needs to set up a private repository. The other team member will then be given access to it. If you
already have access to a private Github account you may want to use your existing one. (It is
important that your repository you use is private, so your code is only shared with your team
partner and nobody else can copy your work.) If this is your first time in the Cloud, an easy way to
get started is to create a free Github account by going to [github.com](https://github.com/) and
signing up with your university email address. This should give you access to an account with free
private repositories. In Github create a new private repository and name it something like `OOP-01`.
Now, on your local machine, navigate into the directory where your .java and .class files are stored
and initialise this directory as a Git repository or 'repo' via:

```shell
> git init
```

Then make sure that you're using the 'main' branch.

```shell
> git checkout -b main
```

**We will be uploading the content of the directory where you run `git init` to GitHub later; do not
just run that command anywhere, only do it inside your project directory.**

Git should tell you that it has initialised a new repository. This command will create a new, hidden
`.git` folder within your directory that will contain all data necessary to manage a repository in
your directory. Next we want to add all our project files to the repository, so they are actually
managed. Use the following command within your directory to do this:

```shell
> git add .
```

(Note that in future you may not want to add .class files since those can be reproduced from source
code) We can now check out our repository by probing its status:

```shell
> git status
```

This will provide you with the list of the new files that are in your repository (in green) and some
info. To commit the current version of files (that is taking a snapshot of the current system)
execute:

```shell
> git commit -am "initial version"
```

The -a option says to commit all the changes and additions you have made. The -m option says to
include a one-line message describing the changes made since the last commit. If you probe the
repository status now you should get a clean (no files listed) return. From here on, a very brief
summary of your workflow when using Git is roughly:

```shell
# do a small amount of work
# get the project back into a working (e.g compiling) state

> git status  # see what's changed
> git add X   # track new files

#  you may wish to edit .gitignore to ignore unwanted files at this point

> git commit -am "Description the changes you have made" # take a snapshot
```

Now it is time to link your local repository to the Github repository you have created online. To do
this, we first connect your local project directory with your online repository:

Windows users:
```shell
> git remote add origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/OOP-01.git
```
Linux and Mac users:
```shell
> git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/OOP-01.git
```

where USERNAME is the username used to create the repository. (Depending on how you set up your
repository, you might first have to remove your link to the existing origin, e.g.
via `git remote rm origin`). Once this is set up it is time to upload (or *push*) your committed
project files to the online repository for the first time:

```shell
> git branch -m main # needed because older git versions still defaults to `master`
> git push -u origin main
```

This will ask you for your Github password. Once this is entered, your files will be uploaded to the
Cloud, and you will have succeeded in setting up an online project repository for your team.


* * *

**TODO:** Make sure you can create online repositories and use basic Git commands for managing its
content.

* * *

## Working Together

Now, if your team partner wants to work with you, you can share your repository. First you should
give your partner shared access to your Github repository online (only **ONE** team member create
the repository and share it with everyone else). To share a repository in Github, add your team
member's email as shown below.
![](bb_setup.png)  
One you click _Invite a collaborator_, your partner should receive an email.

If you have not set up a public key for GitHub follow these steps:

Windows Users:
Download git bash and follow the steps

Linux Users:
```sh
> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
Then go into GitHub under user settings go to `SSH and GPG keys`,
Create a new key and paste the output from the terminal into the key field.

MacOS Users:

Make sure you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed and run `brew install gh`. After it has installed run: 

```sh
> gh auth login
```

and follow the instructions to login. Select GitHub.com when asked where to authenticate. 

Accept the invitation, and you should be taken to the repository. Take note of the repository clone
command at the top of the page, it should look like:

Windows users:
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/THE_USERNAME_OF_THE_PERSON_WHO_CREATED_THE_REPO_AND_SHARED_IT_WITH_YOU/foo.git
```
Linux and Mac users:
```sh
> git clone git@github.com:THE_USERNAME_OF_THE_PERSON_WHO_CREATED_THE_REPO_AND_SHARED_IT_WITH_YOU/foo.git
```
Clone the repository with the command. When you are collaborating, each partner has a clone of the
same online repo. You need to make sure you can both read from and write to it. Your workflow is
now, roughly:

```shell
> git pull    # update project from remote before you start working! 

# do a small amount of work
# get the project back into a working (e.g compiling) state

> git status  # see what's changed
> git add .   # track new files

#  you may wish to edit .gitignore to ignore unwanted files at this point

> git commit -am "Description the changes you have made" # take a snapshot
> git push    # upload to remote
```

If the push command doesn't work, one common problem is that you forgot to commit first. But a more
serious problem is that your partner has pushed changes while you have been working. Your first
attempt at solving the problem should be to try git pull. This will cause git to try to merge the
downloaded changes from your partner with your committed changes. If the changes are in separate
files, all will be well, and you can push the result. If there is a file you have both changed, you
will see that the file contains both sets of changes with markers. You need to edit the file (
probably jointly) to merge both sets of changes manually into something meaningful, and remove all
the markers, then commit and push. Sit next to your programming partner on different workstations
and try out all these things. In practice, try to avoid merges on the same file whenever possible,
i.e. try not to work at the same class at the same time when not working together. NOTE: We suggest
starting with HTTPS for cloud connections, and then moving to SSH later when you get fed up with
typing your account password.

* * *

**TODO:** Practice development where you work one after the other (Intellij and Atom are installed
as IDEs/editors on the lab machines).

**TODO:** Practice development where you work simultaneously on different files.

**TODO:** Practice development where you work simultaneously on the same file. Try to avoid this
scenario whenever possible.

## Future Submission of Zips

You don't need to submit anything for this exercise. But you will have to submit the project of this
unit to Blackboard some time in the future - there we will ask you to submit a zip file of your
repository. You might think that you can just zip from the directory above the project directory.
Although just zipping your project folder works, it contains the entire history of your project in
the .git subdirectory, so this is not a good idea. A better idea, from inside the project directory,
is to type:

```shell
> git commit -am "All done!"
> git archive main -o project.zip
```

This zips up a current snapshot of your project. Apart from having a strange hash string as the
title, this is a normal zip file. Check what's in the zip file, e.g. by unzipping it somewhere.

* * *

**TODO:** Check you know how to make zip files for future submissions.
