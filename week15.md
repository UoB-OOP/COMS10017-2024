# Task 2: Worksheets

For this week, please
download [Worksheet 2](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/COMS10017_2023_TB-2/content/oo/pdfs/sheet2_problems.pdf)

Also download 2 skeleton projects: [sheet2_hellomaven.zip](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/COMS10017_2023_TB-2/content/oo/pdfs/sheet2_hellomaven.zip) and [sheet2_zoo.zip](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/COMS10017_2023_TB-2/content/oo/pdfs/sheet2_zoo.zip) that you'll need for questions 5 and 6 respectively.

There is a lot of material in this worksheet, and we do not expect you to complete it all during the lab. **Questions 5 and 6 are most relevant to the summative assignment** and we suggest you start there.

These worksheets are not credit bearing. You are encouraged to work in your with your partner. We find that students who complete these worksheets typically get higher marks in the summative coursework at the end.

Solutions will be released "later".
