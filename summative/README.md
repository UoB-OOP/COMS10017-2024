The Scotland Yard Project
=========================

## Fixes and workarounds for Apple Silicon: [staying in Apple Land](https://github.com/UoB-OOP/COMS10017-2024/blob/main/summative/applefix.md) and [using Ubuntu on Virtual Machine](https://github.com/UoB-OOP/COMS10017-2024/blob/main/guides/applesiliconvmguide.md)

Welcome to the Scotland Yard project!
The project will help you to develop your programming skills, in particular to gain further
competence, confidence and agility in the way you write object-oriented programs. The project will
conclude in an unmarked competition event.

During the next few weeks, you will develop components for a Java application that allows you to
simulate and play a digital version of the popular board game "Scotland Yard".

The project is to be completed in pair programming teams of two as registered during the start of
the term. Make sure you do not exchange code between teams and ensure your repositories are private
to your two team members at all times. Manage your time well; let us know early if you struggle or
have issues in your team. Meet regularly in your team and stay in contact.

The project consists of two parts:

* The implementation of a core game component `cw-model`
* The implementation of an open-ended AI extension `cw-ai`

You will need to produce a 3-page PDF report accompanying your work. The assessment will be a VIVA
at the end of term where you present your work and where we will discuss how you have understood
and/or used the Java concepts and features described in lectures.

Before you start on this project, make sure you have completed all previous lab worksheets/tasks.
Use the labs, and Microsoft Teams to ask questions (do not spend hours debugging on your own!). Do
not post potentially credit-bearing code snippets on Teams. It is essential that you make the most
of lab sessions where you can discuss your progress with our lab team and get help on the spot. In
case both lab sessions and Teams have not provided an answer, see a lecturer after one of the
lectures or during labs. The recommended time spent for this coursework is 30h in pair programming
teams. Manage your workload well, meet regularly in your team and avoid leaving the implementation
late.

See the task description page for each part to get started:

* **IMPORTANT - you will need to use JAVA 17 for all operating systems**
